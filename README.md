# footprints

Footprints of previous HTTP requests queried via a GET request to /footprints endpoint.

To configure rooutes to footprint use `config/route.json` which is pretty self explanatory. The project uses `express` npm package which is a Sinatra/Flask-like lightweight rapid web-app framework for NodeJS.

To run the package, run the following commands in the source root
```
$> npm install
$> node .
```
and you're away.
